# Types of Applications

An application, in this context, is any piece of code that will interact with Fyle APIs. There are two kinds of applications you can build. The primary difference between them is how you can authorize the application to access your data.

1. Internal: This the more common type of application. If your application will only be used by your organization, this is the right type for you. To learn how to create and authorize an internal application, proceed to the [Internal Application](./internal-application.md) page.

2. OAuth 2.0: These are generally multi-tenant integrations and you expect multiple distinct organizations to use it. These are generally built by partners of Fyle who are building integrations for a number of their customers. If you are interested in building an OAuth 2.0 application, do send us a note at platform-beta@fylehq.com. Please proceed to the [OAuth 2.0 Application](./oauth2-application.md) page for instructions on how to create and authorize this type of application.
