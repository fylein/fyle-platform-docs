# üëã Welcome to Fyle Platform APIs (beta)

[Fyle](https://www.fylehq.com) is an expense management SaaS product for companies that want to save their employees the headache of managing their business expenses. If you don't have a Fyle account, please visit our [website](https://www.fylehq.com).

You're probably here because you want to build some interesting applications or integrations that read / write to Fyle. Whatever it is you want to do, you should be able to find APIs for them here.

Here are some quick links to important parts of the documentation:

* [Introduction](https://docs.fylehq.com/docs/fyle-platform-docs/ZG9jOjE-introduction) section is the best place to start. You'll learn a bunch of concepts that are important before you start building.
* [Application](https://docs.fylehq.com/docs/fyle-platform-docs/ZG9jOjE1NDM0NzI2-application) section walks you through how to register an app with Fyle.
* [Authorization](https://docs.fylehq.com/docs/fyle-platform-docs/ZG9jOjE1NDM0NzI3-authorization) sections will talk about how to authorize the app to act on a user's behalf
* [Guide to APIs](https://docs.fylehq.com/docs/fyle-platform-docs/ZG9jOjI3Mzk2NTM3-guide-to-data-ap-is) will make it easier to understand how to use the APIs to the fullest
* [Admin API Reference](https://docs.fylehq.com/docs/fyle-platform-docs/YXBpOjQwNjU3MA-admin-ap-is) covers all the APIs your application will have access to if authorized by an admin
* [Fyler API Reference](https://docs.fylehq.com/docs/fyle-platform-docs/YXBpOjQ2MTc2NTg-fyler-ap-is) covers all the APIs your application will have access to if authorized by a fyler


<!-- theme: warning -->

> #### üí° You're in Beta Land
>
> While you have access to a very rich set of APIs, these APIs are currently in beta and there may be some niggles. We might even make some minor changes to the API endpoints in this phase (we'll avoid this as much as possible). If you do decide to try out these APIs, please send us a note at platform-beta@fylehq.com so that we can assist you in case of any issues.
