  summary: Check expense for policy violation
  description: |
    Before creating or updating an [expense object](https://docs.fylehq.com/docs/fyle-platform-docs/b5ec89140e06b-create-or-update-expense)
    into Sage Exp Mgmt, based on the business requirements, you might want to check that 
    expense against the policy rules set up by your organization. You can easily do that by passing the same expense object 
    that you want to create/update to this API, along with some extra optional fields documented below.
    Note that, however based on whether you are creating or updating an expense, some fields may be mandatory as mentioned explicitly by _Note_.
