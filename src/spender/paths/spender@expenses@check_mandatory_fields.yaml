  summary: Check expense for missing mandatory fields
  description: |
    Before creating or updating an [expense object](https://docs.fylehq.com/docs/fyle-platform-docs/b5ec89140e06b-create-or-update-expense)
    into Fyle, based on the business requirements, you might want to check if you have added all the mandatory fields set up by your organization.
    You can easily do that by passing the same expense object with some extra optional fields documented below.
  operationId: check_mandatory_fields_post
  requestBody:
    required: true

                            nullable: true
                      example:
                        - comment_type: "MISSING_FIELDS"
                          comment_text: "Reason for missing fields"
