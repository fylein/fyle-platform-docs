    This API returns budgets that are visible to the spender based on budget visibility settings.
    Budgets are filtered based on the user's presence in the budget_user_visibility table.
    
    This API supports very rich filtering on all response fields and pagination via query parameters. 
    To understand how to use these parameters, please see the [Guide to Data APIs](https://docs.fylehq.com/docs/fyle-platform-docs/ZG9jOjI3Mzk2NTM3-guide-to-data-ap-is#filtering)
