                  offset is used to skip that many number of objects before
                  counting. <br>

                  For example, if there are 2000 objects, <br>

                  The first request will have offset as 0 and limit as 1000 to
                  return first 1000 objects. <br>

                  The second request will have offset as 1000 and limit as 1000
                  to return next 1000 objects. <br>
