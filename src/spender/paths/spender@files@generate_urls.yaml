  summary: Generate download and upload URLs
  description: |
    Once a file is created, its contents may need to be uploaded (or downloaded). To upload (or download) contents, you'll
    need to generate a temporary signed URL. This API accomplishes that. The signed URL is valid for 5 mins.
    Note: upload_url will be null if the file is linked to an expense or advance request in approved or higher state.
