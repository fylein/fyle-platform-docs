  summary: Bulk generate download and upload URLs for files under the current user's hierarchy
  description: |
    Once a file is created, its contents may need to be uploaded (or downloaded). To upload (or download) contents, you'll
    need to generate a temporary signed URL. This API accomplishes that. The signed URL is valid for 5 mins.
    This API validates that all requested files belong to users in the approver's hierarchy,
    then generates upload and download URLs for those files.
