        Before creating or updating an [expense object](https://docs.fylehq.com/docs/fyle-platform-docs/b5ec89140e06b-create-or-update-expense)
        into Sage Exp Mgmt, based on the business requirements, you might want to check that 
        expense against the policy rules set up by your organization. You can easily do that by passing the same expense object 
        that you want to create/update to this API, along with some extra optional fields documented below.
        Note that, however based on whether you are creating or updating an expense, some fields may be mandatory as mentioned explicitly by _Note_.

        Bulk version of the `check_policies` API that allows you to check multiple expenses for policy violations in one request.

        **NOTE:** This API can only be used to check policies for existing expenses that you want to update. The API will evaluate all the expenses against the configured policy rules and return an array of policy violation information for each expense in the request payload.

        - Expense Policy Comments
      summary: Add expense policy comment
      description: |
        This API adds or updates expense policy comments. 

        **Note:** 
        - If the specified `comment_type` already exists for the expense, the API will update the existing comment's `comment_text` with the new value provided, rather than creating a new comment entry.
        - If the `comment_type` is specified and the `comment_text` is null or an empty string, the comment will be deleted for that expense.
