        Once a file is created, its contents may need to be uploaded (or downloaded). To upload (or download) contents, you'll
        need to generate a temporary signed URL. This API accomplishes that. The signed URL is valid for 5 mins.
        The upload URL will be null if the file is linked to an expense or advance request in approved or higher state.

      description: |
        This API gets you the saved export configurations for expenses in the current organization.

        Export configurations allow users to save and reuse export settings including column selections, 
        formulas, sort orders, and formatting preferences.

        This API supports very rich filtering on all response fields and pagination via query parameters. To understand how to use these parameters, please see the [Guide to Data APIs](https://docs.fylehq.com/docs/fyle-platform-docs/ZG9jOjI3Mzk2NTM3-guide-to-data-ap-is#filtering)

          description: |
            This represents the status of policy computation for the input expense object against the policy represented by `expense_policy_rule_id`.
            If the state is `UNVIOLATED`, it means that the expense is not violating this policy. If the state is `VIOLATION_ACTION_SUCCESS`,
            it means that the expense is violating this policy and action stated in the object will be applied to the expense when it is saved.
            However, if the state is `VIOLATION_ACTION_FAILURE`, it means that this policy is violated for the expense but since some approver was
            missing or not set up properly, it will fail to take action on the expense when it is saved.
